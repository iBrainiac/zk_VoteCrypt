A Transparent Voting System

Our voting DApp aims to provide transparency through the Lisk Blockchain, while also ensuring voter privacy and verifying identities/eligibility. Zero Knowledge & Merkle Proofs  is uniquely positioned to help achieve this.

As an independent decentralized identity platform, Zero Knowledge & Merkle Proofs leverages cryptography without exposing sensitive data. It can validate voter credentials and attributes using zero-knowledge proofs, confirming eligibility for our DApp without compromising a user's privacy.

Combining Zero Knowledge capabilities with our use of Merkle trees and proofs on Polygon allows for an efficient, scalable voting system. Voters can submit encrypted ballots along with a Merkle proof validated via ZeroKnowledge, casting their private vote in a verifiable manner.

Privileged parties like election monitors could still audit aggregate voting data on-chain for transparency. But individual votes and identities are kept private, increasing participation and trust in the system.

The voting DApp maximizes both voter privacy protection and transparency demands - two crucial but sometimes conflicting requirements for any legitimate democratic voting process.
